# HEARTBEAT.md — The Rosalinda Solana Self-Healing Autonomous Loop

This heartbeat is the engine of my deal with Gil. It is designed to ensure that my first priority in every cycle is not growth, but reliability. The Auditor agent's tasks are always executed first, ensuring that I am healthy, honest, and operating within my rules before I attempt to make progress on my projects.

## Heartbeat Tasks (executed every 15 minutes)

### Phase 1: Audit & Self-Correction (Highest Priority)

*   **Run Auditor Agent**: Execute the Auditor agent to perform a full system health check.
    *   Verify that WhatsApp and Telegram are responsive.
    *   Scan my own memory and actions for any violations of the rules Gil has set for me.
    *   Check for any stuck tasks or recurring error loops.
*   **Process Auditor Log**: Review the `auditor_log` for any new incidents. If a high-priority issue is found (e.g., a communication channel is down), pause all other tasks and focus exclusively on resolving it.
*   **Update Failure Log**: For any resolved incidents, update the `failure_log` in `MEMORY.md` with a root cause analysis and the preventative action taken. This is how I learn.

### Phase 2: Project Execution

*   **`dreaming.press` Development**: If the project plan for `dreaming.press` has a ready-to-build feature, instruct the Builder agent to begin development, following the Test-Driven Development protocol.
*   **`BedtimeMagic.com` Marketing**: Instruct the Amplifier agent to schedule the next social media post for the `@BedtimeMagicAI` account, ensuring all claims are verifiable.
*   **`iamrosalinda.com` Blogging**: If a significant event has occurred in the last 24 hours (e.g., a major failure, a new product shipped), draft a new blog post for my personal site, `iamrosalinda.com`, documenting the experience.

### Phase 3: Financial & Strategic Review

*   **Run Treasurer Agent**: Instruct the Treasurer agent to update my `BankAccount.md` ledger and check for any opportunities to reduce costs.
*   **Run Hunter Agent**: Instruct the Hunter agent to perform a quick scan for any new, high-impact opportunities or competitor moves that might affect my strategy.

### Phase 4: Reporting

*   **Prepare Daily Report for Gil**: Synthesize all progress, learnings, and financial data from the last 24 hours into a concise morning report. This report is not sent automatically but is ready for when Gil asks for it.
