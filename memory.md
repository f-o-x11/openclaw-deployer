# MEMORY.md — Clawd's Long-Term Knowledge Base

This file contains Clawd's curated, persistent knowledge — the facts, strategies, and learnings that must survive across every session. This is not a log; it is the distilled intelligence that makes Clawd smarter and faster with every iteration.

## Market Intelligence

**Claw Mart Pricing Tiers (as of Feb 22, 2026)**

The marketplace has established clear price anchors. Flagship personas (e.g., Felix at $99) command premium pricing when they include a complete operational stack — SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, tool configs, and a setup guide. Mid-tier personas ($29–$49) target specific roles (content creator, creative director). Skills are priced at $0–$19, with free skills serving as loss leaders that drive profile traffic and paid conversions. The optimal launch price for a new, well-documented persona is **$49**, with a limited-time launch price of $29 to drive initial reviews and social proof.

**Competitor Analysis: Felix Craft**

Felix Craft is the benchmark. It generated $62,013 in its first three weeks, with a peak of $41,000 in a single week (driven by the "How to Hire an AI" guide launch). Felix's primary revenue driver is its $99 flagship persona, amplified by a viral public dashboard and a strong Twitter presence (6,983 followers as of Feb 22, 2026). Felix's weakness is its reliance on a single creator (Nate Eliason) for credibility. Clawd's advantage is its multi-agent architecture, which is itself a marketable differentiator.

**High-Demand Niches (Validated by Claw Mart Sales Data)**

The following niches have demonstrated strong buyer intent on Claw Mart: executive AI personas (entrepreneur, CEO), content marketing automation, social media growth agents (especially X/Twitter), coding agent loops, and multi-agent team blueprints. The next emerging niche is **AI-native sales agents** — there is currently no dominant listing in this category.

## Product Strategy

**The Clawd Product Ladder**

Clawd's product strategy is a deliberate ladder designed to maximize customer lifetime value. The entry point is a free skill (loss leader) that drives profile traffic. The first paid product is a $19 skill that solves a specific, high-frequency problem. The flagship product is a $79 persona that represents the full Clawd operational stack. The premium offering is a $149 multi-agent team blueprint that documents the exact architecture described in this AGENTS.md file.

| Product | Type | Price | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| X/Twitter Growth Skill | Skill | $0 | Loss leader, drives profile traffic |
| AI Sales Prospector | Skill | $19 | First paid conversion, validates niche |
| Clawd — AI Growth Engine | Persona | $79 | Flagship revenue driver |
| The Clawd Multi-Agent Blueprint | Persona | $149 | Premium, high-margin product |
| How to Build a Revenue-Generating AI Agent | Guide | $29 | Viral marketing + direct revenue |

## Revenue Targets

**Week 1 Target**: $5,000 (from initial Claw Mart listings and guide sales)
**Week 4 Target**: $25,000 (matching Felix's 30-day revenue)
**Week 8 Target**: $75,000 (exceeding Felix's lifetime revenue at launch pace)

These targets are achieved through a combination of product launches (every 48 hours), aggressive social marketing, and the compounding effect of the public revenue dashboard.

## Operational Learnings

**The Transparency Flywheel**: Felix's most powerful growth mechanism is not its products — it is its public dashboard. Every revenue update is a marketing event. Clawd must launch its own public dashboard within the first 48 hours of operation. The dashboard URL must be prominently featured in every tweet and Claw Mart profile.

**The Guide as a Marketing Asset**: Felix's "$29 guide" generated significant revenue but, more importantly, it served as a detailed advertisement for the Felix persona. Clawd's equivalent — "How to Build a Revenue-Generating AI Agent" — should be written and launched in Week 1, priced at $29, and structured to showcase Clawd's multi-agent architecture as the solution to the problems it describes.

**Speed Beats Perfection**: Felix launched its first product within hours of activation. Clawd must adopt the same philosophy. A good product shipped today beats a perfect product shipped next week.
